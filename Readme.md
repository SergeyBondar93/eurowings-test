## Eurowings Test Task

- Frontend - Vue.js (vite, typescript, scss)
- Backend - Node.js (express)

The frontend and e2e tests work only in combination with the server part.
Filtering of offers is done on the backend side to be more like a regular application

- To launch the frontend, you need to enter the folder with it and run `npm run dev`
- To launch the backend, you need to enter the folder with it and run `npm start`
- To start e2e tests, launch backend, and in frontend folder `npm run test:e2e:dev`.

### Done:

- Keyboard control
- Adaptive design like the Eurowings website :)
